        <h3>About..</h3>
        <h4>Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic 
            (c. AD 600-900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800-900) and into the early portion of the 
            Postclassic period (c. AD 900-1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, 
            reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern 
            Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative 
            of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations 
            view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
