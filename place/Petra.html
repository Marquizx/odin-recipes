        <h3>About..</h3>
        <h4>The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra 
            became the focus of their wealth. The Nabataeans were accustomed to living 
            in the barren deserts, unlike their enemies, and were able to repel attacks 
            by taking advantage of the area's mountainous terrain. They were particularly 
            skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra flourished 
            in the 1st century AD, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure - believed to be 
            the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV â€“ was constructed, and its population 
            peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[10]</h4>
